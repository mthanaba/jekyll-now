A young couple figuring out life one adventure at a time..... well that's the tagline that was excecutively  decided upon by M when he took forever to set up this site. 

The COVID-19 pandemic forced B&M to the confines of a 599 sqft box in the Toronto skyline for 6 months. Our lease had expired on said $2,000 CAD/month box and we said no more, this site documents our thought process in determining our next steps and over adventures thereafter.
